					<h2>A Love for Creation</h2>
					<p>
						From the time I was 8 years old I knew what I wanted to be when I grew up. "Artist" is what I would tell people. The joy of making. It's a passion I hold dearly to this day.
					</p>
					<p>
						Art isn't just a thing you do. It's a whole process. After years of projects, I can say with confidence that I'm well equiped to bring my imaginatinon to life with intent.

					<h2>Restaurant Rockstar</h2>
					<p>
						Alright, 'rockstar' is a bit of an exageration. But for nearly a decade I thrived in the industry and worked every position you can imagine short of managing the entire establishment. 
					</p>
					<p>
						As a natural introvert, working directly with customers forced me to break out of my shy shell. I wouldn't trade the experience for anything because it taught me the personal growth that comes with getting outside of my comfort zone.

					<h2>Technical Awakening</h2>
					<p>
						My search for better-paying, reliable work incedentaly led me to automotive. I was bit by the fix-it bug. Solving tricky problems and fixing vehicles felt like having magic powers. 
					</p>
					<P>
						What drove my success as someone who had no clue what they were doing was my ability to understand cars as a compilation of systems. Once I learned the 'why', I was able to develop a knack for diagnostics. There's a science to finding problems within increasing complex systems.

					<h2>Love at First Type</h2>
					<p>
						After months of exploring career options I decided to try my hand at coding. From the first time I saw my name on the tab of a browser window my heart skipped a beat. I couldn't believe I had so much creative power at my finger tips. "Where has this been all my life," I wondered to myself. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I quickly discovered that development was a home where I could practice all my passions. With code, my artistic leanings are allowed to create beautiful and useful programs. There is never a shortage of new and interesting challenges to tackle, which also means there's no shortage of lessons in humility. I can't think of anything else I would rather do than work to build technologies that connect people and help make the world just that much better for the people that use that technology.
